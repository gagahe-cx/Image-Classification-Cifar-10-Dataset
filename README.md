# Image-Classification-Cifar-10-Dataset
This project mainly employes '''Python''' to perform image classification on 
the classic Cifar-10 dataset. 

It is comprised of three parts:
  1) PCA method
  2) SVM model
  3) CNN models

Brilliant points:
  1) The CNN models did not employ the existing architectures like ResNet, 
Inception, DenseNet, etc. Instead, it is designed recursively following the idea of ResNet. Explore it!
  2) The CNN models indicates a prediction accuracy of 95.5% at most for one type.
